[MOD] In "Get Header from TD.vi", optimized code by changing from TypeCast to explicit manipulation of data.
[MOD] In various VIs, replaced "Variant to Header Info.vi" with "Variant to Flattened String" (where header info not used).
[FIX] Changed dependency on "ogrsc_dynamicpalette>=2.0" (incorrect) to "ogrsc_dynamicpalette>=0.2" (correct)
